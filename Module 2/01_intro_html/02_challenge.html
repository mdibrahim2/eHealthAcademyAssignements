        Nobody’s born <em>smart</em>. We all start at <strong>0.</strong> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <strong>algebra.</strong><br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are <em>born</em> to learn.<br>
        <strong> Surely.</strong> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</strong><br>
        <strong>Failing</strong> is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <em>learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole <strong>universe</strong><br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
       <strong> Whoever you are, wherever you are.<strong<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
