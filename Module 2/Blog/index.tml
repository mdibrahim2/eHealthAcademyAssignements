  To guide you through this jungle of information and advice, DataCamp has revamped its <span class="span">"Become a Data Scientist in 8 Steps"</span> infographic : it now provides an updated view of the eight steps
   that you need to to through to learn data science. Some of these eight steps will be easier for some than for others, depending on background and personal experience, among other factors.

The goal, however, is still to make this a visual guide for everyone that is interested in
learning data science or for everyone that has already become a data scientist or part of a data science team but wants some additional resources for further perfection.

    I started native iOS development in 2010. There was no automatic reference counting (ARC) and you have to use Objective-C as your primary language. I created my first app (ABC POP) in 7 days and after that I was hooked. All I wanted to do is native iOS development.
  Unfortunately, most of the companies in Houston were not interested in native iOS apps. These companies were in the business of oil/gas, energy, medicine, finance etc. I would sit in meetings where they make the case for cross platform frameworks like PhoneGap, Ionic, Xamarin etc. This left me frustrated as I wanted to create native iOS apps.
  It was only after I saw things from their point of view that I realize that these companies are NOT in the business of making apps. They are simply using mobile as a medium to channel information to their internal employees. They wanted a bigger bang for their buck and did not wanted to spend resources on creating and maintaining two
  separate codebases and managing two different set of teams.  </p>
